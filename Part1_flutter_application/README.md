# transmission_app

A flutter based application that was initially used to compute transmission lines parameters. The scope of this project has been widened and now serve 3 main purposes:
1. Solution generation
2. Chatbot
3. Image recognition

## Solution generator

The application's utility relies heavily on its ability to provide
solutions. The image recognition component carefully processes the query or question supplied in the image. Afterwards, a thorough solution is created, providing users with a resolution to their query. This approach offers customers the ability to customise the presentation according to their tastes, allowing them to choose between LaTeX or text format.
 
## Chatbot

The application allows users to have conversations with a Language Model
(LLM) that covers a wide range of academic disciplines. This interactive tool enables users to start conversations, ask questions, and seek clarification on certain academic topics of interest.
## Image Recognition

Users can utilise this feature to upload photographs for extensive evaluation. Based on the query submitted by the user, the system conducts a complex analysis of the visual content and produces a logical output that corresponds to the subject matter depicted
